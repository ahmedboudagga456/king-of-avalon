    <h2>Spectra Phantom</h2>
    <p>Spectra and Infinity Helios return in Interspace Under Siege, having received Marucho's distress SOS call and arriving in Bakugan Interspace via a Dimension Tunnel. He reveals that he and Helios had to change to Darkus in order for Helios MK2 to evolve into Infinity Helios. He then assists Shun Kazami, Rafe, Paige and Marucho Marukura in helping to get rid of Chaos Bakugan from Bakugan Interspace and easily defeats them all using Helios' new powers. He and the other then battle Team Anubias and Team Sellon's Bakugan. But the fight gets interrupted when Dan returns.</p>

    <h2>Dan Kuso</h2>
    <p>One year after defeating Barodius, Dan and Drago have returned to Bakugan Interspace and help Marucho expand it. Two rival teams, Team Anubias and Team Sellon have emerged and are trying to challenge the Brawlers' status as top-ranked battlers. Dan and Drago start off by beating two unknown Subterra and Darkus brawlers rather easily. Drago however misses when he shoots his fire attack. Also, the two of them have been having visions of a masked man named Mag Mel and a Bakugan named Razenoid demanding that they give him their power. The next day, Dan was challenged by one of the members of Team Anubias, Ben using Bolcanon and Horridian. Dan manages to defeat him, but Drago loses control of his powers and nearly destroys the arena.

      <h4>Pamela Shwartz</h4>
      <p>Paige and Rafe first appear in A Royale Pain, arriving from Neathia to help Shun Kazami after Taylean creates Silent Strike. Boulderon teaches Taylean a few pointers, while Rafe and Wolfurio chase Silent Strike away. After Silent Strike retreats, she reveals she is a Gundalian and tells them what Mechtogan really are. She continues to insult the Brawlers' weaknesses, with Rafe agreeing with her. She and Rafe also explain that they were both sent by Fabia Sheen to help the Battle Brawlers out.</p>

      <h4>Rafe Waver </h4>
      <p id="last">In A Royale Pain, he and Paige arrive from Neathia to help Shun when Silent Strike is created from Taylean, who then starts wreaking havoc. He uses Lanzato to paralyze Silent Strike, who then disappears into the sky. At the end of the episode, he seems to be surprised about Shun's performance in the battle while Paige calls the Brawlers "weak." Later they tell them what Mechtogan really are, confusing Marucho and angering Shun. He and Paige also mention that they were both sent by Princess Fabia to help the brawlers out.</p>
